#### Notifications
Event.Notify()->Subscriber(Who, How)

#### Event
int occurrences
int&[] subscribers

if eventHappened
    inc Occurrence
    notify subscribers

Note: We might not want to constantly increase (maybe loop) occurrences because they might overflow.
Note: Do we need to track occurrences?
